# Classifying Stuttering Events with Sep28K

This repository contains code for preprocessing the [Sep28k](https://github.com/apple/ml-stuttering-events-dataset) corpus and training a model for both binary (fluency/disfluency) and multiclass ('Prolongation', 'Block', 'SoundRep', 'WordRep', 'Interjection', 'NoStutteredWords') classification. 

The user is assumed to have downloaded the relevant files from the original Sep28k repo. 

The first step is to run the following:

```preprocess.py```

This returns a dictionary containing F0, MFB, and wav2vec 2.0 features, and dictionaries for the labels and audio file paths. 

To train a model on these features:

```train.py --model --batch_size --num_epochs

This `train.py` allows one to select a model from the `models.py` file and generates the dataset from the `dataset.py' file.

Following training the `utils.py` contains a plotting function to show the binary and multiclass losses and F1 scores.
